# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion solution

This is a solution to the [FAQ accordion challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-wyfFdeBwBz). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.


## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript - For interaction

### What I learned

- With the help of a friend on LinkedIn, I understood the `for` loop much better and how to use it to iterate through my icons so I wouldn't have seperate set of instructions for each icon
- Also learned about the `keydown` EventListener
- Lastly, I learned how to use `this.closest()` with `querySelector()` aside the other few JS methods I had known before

### Continued development

The `for` loop pretty much made things easy for me, if not I had actually planned to write seperate instructions for each icon which would have made my code much more longer and repeated in a way. I'll take my time to play around with loops and get more comfortable with them and also dive deeper into more areas of JavaScript.
